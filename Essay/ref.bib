  abstract = {Modelling in finance is a challenging task: the data often has complex statistical properties and its inner workings are largely unknown. Deep learning algorithms are making progress in the field of data-driven modelling, but the lack of sufficient data to train these models is currently holding back several new applications. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a neural network architecture family that has achieved good results in image generation and is being successfully applied to generate time series and other types of financial data. The purpose of this study is to present an overview of how these GANs work, their capabilities and limitations in the current state of research with financial data, and present some practical applications in the industry. As a proof of concept, three known GAN architectures were tested on financial time series, and the generated data was evaluated on its statistical properties, yielding solid results. Finally, it was shown that GANs have made considerable progress in their finance applications and can be a solid additional tool for data scientists in this field.},

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) became very popular for generation of realistically looking images. In this paper, we propose to use GANs to synthesize artificial financial data for research and benchmarking purposes. We test this approach on three American Express datasets, and show that properly trained GANs can replicate these datasets with high fidelity. For our experiments, we define a novel type of GAN, and suggest methods for data preprocessing that allow good training and testing performance of GANs. We also discuss methods for evaluating the quality of generated data, and their comparison with the original real data.},
