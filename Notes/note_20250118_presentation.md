Presentation organization:
1. estimation of structural parameters (the main questions addressed in the paper)
2. how to estimate? Introduce the GAN algorithm in the context (the main contributions)
    - introduce Adversarial 
    - introduce Net
    - The idea of generative is very much appreciated among different fields.
3. comparison with other methods (how is the paper related to classes' content)
   - Likelihood
   - SMM
   - Bootstrap to get standard errors
   - asymptotic properties summary and comparison
4. Try to connect the paper by Athy_et_al_2021 and this one. (what have you done with the paper, i.e. literature review, extensions of results, simulations, application)
   - review the literature around the theme of the paper 
   - prove / extend some theoretical results (i can not)
   - code the method if not available and show that it works (not enough time)
   - do a simulation exercise to evaluate a new method / compare competing methods (not enough time)
   - entertain an application to a question of interest (no idea)
